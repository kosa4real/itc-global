          <h3>Citizen / Tax Payer Identification</h3>
          <p>fundamental step in administering taxes is taxpayer registration and numbering. Tax administrations must compile and maintain a complete
          database of businesses and individuals that are required by law to register; these will include taxpayers in their own right,
          as well as others such as employers with PAYE withholding responsibilities. Registration and numbering of each taxpayer underpin key
            administrative processes associated with filing, payment, assessment, and collection.</p>

          <p>We provide accurate and reliable taxpayer information. Knowledge of the potential taxpayer base, the adequacy of information held in the
            tax administrationâ€™s registration database and the extent to which it supports effective interactions with taxpayers and tax intermediaries.</p>
